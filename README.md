Description
-----------

pgenv is a simple utility to build and run different releases of [PostgreSQL].
This makes it easy to switch between versions when testing applications for
compatibility.

Installation
------------

1.  Check out pgenv into `~/.pgenv`.

    ``` sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/theory/pgenv.git ~/.pgenv
    ```

2.  Add `~/.pgenv/bin` and `~/.pgenv/pgsql/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to
    the `pgenv` command-line utility and all the programs provided by
    PostgreSQL:
   
    ``` sh
    $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.pgenv/bin:$HOME/.pgenv/pgsql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```

    **Ubuntu note**: Modify your `~/.profile` instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

3.  Restart your shell as a login shell so the path changes take effect. You
    can now begin using pgenv.

    ~~~ sh
    $ exec $SHELL -l
    ~~~

4.  Build a version of PostgreSQL:

    ~~~ sh
    $ pgenv build 10.4
    ~~~

### Configuration

By default, all versions of PostgreSQL will be built in the root of the project
directory (generally, in `~/.pgenv`.). If you'd like them to live elsewhere, set
the `$PGENV_ROOT` environment variable to the appropriate directory.

Each version will be compiled with support for PL/Perl and PL/Python when
`pgenv` can find their interpreters or using the value of the `$PGENV_PERL` and
`$PGENV_PYTHON` variables. See [`pgenv build`](#pgenv-build) below for details.

### Upgrading

You can upgrade your installation to the cutting-edge version at any time
with a simple `git pull`.

~~~ sh
$ cd ~/.pgenv
$ git pull
~~~

### Dependencies
------------

*   env - Sets environment for execution
*   bash - Shell environment for execution
*   curl - Used to download files
*   sed, grep, cat, tar - General Unix command line utilities
*   patch - For patching versions that need patching
*   make -  Builds PostgreSQL
*   Perl 5 - To build PL/Perl (optional)
*   Python - To build PL/Python (optional)

Command Reference
-----------------

Like `git`, the `pgenv` command delegates to subcommands based on its
first argument. The subcommands are:

### pgenv use

Sets the version of PostgreSQL to be used in all shells by symlinking its
directory to `~/$PGENV_ROOT/pgsql` and starting it. Initializes the data
directory if none exists. If another version is currently active, it will be
stopped before switching. If the specified version is already in use, the `use`
command won't stop it, but will initialize its data directory and start it if it
is not already running.

    $ pgenv use 10.4
    waiting for server to shut down.... done
    server stopped
    waiting for server to start.... done
    server started
    PostgreSQL 10.4 started

### pgenv versions

Lists all PostgreSQL versions known to `pgenv`, and shows an asterisk next to
the currently active version (if any). The first column reports versions
available for use by `pgenv` and the second lists the subdirectory of
`$PGENV_ROOT` in which the each version is installed:

    $ pgenv versions
          10.4      pgsql-10.4
          11beta3   pgsql-11beta3
          9.5.13    pgsql-9.5.13
      *   9.6.9     pgsql-9.6.9

In this example, versions `9.5.13`, `9.6.9`, `10.4`, and `11beta3` are available
for use, and the `*` indicates that  `9.6.10` is the currently active version.
Each version is installed in a `pgsql-` subdirectory of `$PGENV_ROOT`.

### pgenv version

Displays the currently active PostgreSQL version.

    $ pgenv version
    pgsql-10.4

### pgenv clear

Clears the currently active version of PostgreSQL. If the current version is
running, `clear` will stop it before clearing it.

    $ pgenv clear
    waiting for server to shut down.... done
    server stopped
    PostgreSQL stopped
    PostgreSQL cleared

### pgenv build

Downloads and builds the specified version of PostgreSQL and its contrib
modules, as far back as 8.0. PostgreSQL versions 8.0 and 8.1 will be patched
before building. If the version is already built, it will not be rebuilt; use
`clear` to remove an existing version before building it again.

    $ pgenv build 10.3
    # [Curl, configure, and make output elided]
    PostgreSQL 10.3 built

The build will include PL/Perl and PL/Python if `pgenv` can find their
interpreters in the current environment. To manually configure PL/Perl and
PL/Python support, set the `$PGENV_PERL` or `$PGENV_PYTHON` to the location of
the desired interpreter. The behavior for both variables is as follows:

-   If the variable is empty or not set, `pgenv` will look for an interpreter in
    the current path.
-   If the variable points to an executable representing the language
    interpreter, the procedural language will be configured using that
    executable.
-   If the variable is set to a non-executable value, such as `no`, the
    procedural language will not be built.

For example, the following will build an instance without PL/Perl and
with a specific version of Python:

    $ PGENV_PERL=no PGENV_PYTHON=/usr/python/2.7/bin/python pgenv build 10.5

### pgenv remove

Removes the specified version of PostgreSQL unless it is the currently-active
version. Use the `clear` command to clear the active version before removing it.

    $ pgenv remove 10.3
    PostgreSQL 10.3 removed

### pgenv start

Starts the currently active version of PostgreSQL if it's not already running.
Initializes the data directory if none exists.

    $ pgenv start
    PostgreSQL started

### pgenv stop

Stops the currently active version of PostgreSQL.

    $ pgenv stop
    PostgreSQL 10.5 stopped
    
It is possible to specify a stop mode as one of the `pg_ctl` recognized modes:
- `smart` (the default)
- `fast`
- `immediate`

    $ pgenv stop immediate
    PostgreSQL 10.5 stopped

See `pg_ctl(1)` documentation for more information about stop modes.

### pgenv restart

Restarts the currently active version of PostgreSQL, or starts it if it's not
already running.

    $ pgenv restart
    PostgreSQL restarted

### pgenv available

Shows all the versions of PostgreSQL available to download and build. Handy to
find a version you want to pass to the `build` command. Note that this command
produces copious output.

    $ pgenv available
    ...
                Available PostgreSQL Versions
    ========================================================

                        PostgreSQL 9.6
        ------------------------------------------------
        9.6.0   9.6.1   9.6.2   9.6.3   9.6.4   9.6.5
        9.6.6   9.6.7   9.6.8   9.6.9   9.6.10

                        PostgreSQL 10
        ------------------------------------------------
        10.0    10.1    10.2    10.3    10.4    10.5

                        PostgreSQL 11
        ------------------------------------------------
        11beta1  11beta2  11beta3

The versions are organized and sorted by major release number. Any listed
version may be passed to the `build` command.

To limit the list to versions for specific major releases, pass them to
`available`. For example, to list only the `9.6` and `10` available versions:

    $ pgenv available 10 9.6
                Available PostgreSQL Versions
    ========================================================

                        PostgreSQL 9.6
        ------------------------------------------------
        9.6.0   9.6.1   9.6.2   9.6.3   9.6.4   9.6.5
        9.6.6   9.6.7   9.6.8   9.6.9   9.6.10

                        PostgreSQL 10
        ------------------------------------------------
        10.0    10.1    10.2    10.3    10.4    10.5

### pgenv check

Checks the list of commands required to download and build PostgreSQL. Prints a
result for each, with either the path to the command or an error reporting that
the command was not found.

### pgenv help

Outputs a brief usage statement and summary of available commands, like
the following:

    Usage: pgenv <command> [<args>]

    The pgenv commands are:
